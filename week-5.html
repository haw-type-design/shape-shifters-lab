                We are quickly approaching mid term. Now that we have a solid base of first letters, we can start to expand. The basics are set, so we now need to produce further letter shapes. We do not necessarily need to proceed in a particular order. Starting with our modular shapes, we can derive forms from others. How do rounds look? How do diagonals look? Take inspiration from your exisiting forms and try to translate them to the newly drawn. As a reference: at least one charcter set (including the characters that you need) should be feasible for mid term, if possible opt for more!

            <div class="text">
                While working on your fonts: be realistic. Carefully measure what you can achieve and what you need. Do you need a full set of characters? Do you need all the numerals? If you have more than one axis and know what you want to do: can you add your third axis when you have time? Or do you need to advance everything at the same go? <br>
                It might be better to draw just a few things and tweak them until they are really good and not opt for something unrealistic and then produce letter that do not have the quality that you want them to have. Now it should be something like a mantra: test, test, test. On screen, paper, whatever you can imagine.
