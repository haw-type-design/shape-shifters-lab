                Setting up the content structure
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
                This week we will do two things: set up our content structure and dive deeper into animations. But first things first. <br>
                For our texts we will need to think a bit like we could think when we were working in a layout software. So thinking about content in terms of headlines, sub-headlines, pull-out quotes, body text, etc.. Depending on your fonts, we might need to decide as a group, if we want to use, say, one additional font for body texts, if the fonts are less suited for small sizes. So let’s discuss that in group this week. But back to layout. <br>
                We can think of this like organizing a page in layout software. So we can start to give headlines a class, subheadlines, pull-out quotes and everything else as well. Then we can start to assemble everything by putting the text between the corresponding tags. <br>
                Once we got that set up, let’s start to think about what goes where and how we want to style it.

                Animations
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
                A thing that we can quickly take a look into (advanced reading on this down below) are animations. Most of the things that we can assign as CSS values are animatable. We can make use of this to animate our variable fonts, using a technique called keyframes. We could set up a simple animation as follows:
                <code>
                    &lt;div class="vfont"&gt;
                    Headline
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                </code> as our HTML markup using the vfont class to animate our font.<br>
                We could add in some styling using CSS like so:<br>
                <code>
                    .vfont {<br>
                    font-family: "MyFont";<br>
                    animation: my-animation 2s infinite alternate;<br>
                    }<br>
                    <br>
                    @keyframes my-animation {<br>
                    0%{<br>
                    font-variation-settings: "VROT" -30, "HROT" 30;<br>
                    }<br>
                    100%{<br>
                    font-variation-settings: "VROT" 30, "HROT" -30;<br>
                    }<br>
                    }
                </code> 
                With the first part we set the animation to be <code>my-animation</code> and play forawrds and backwards imfinitely. One animation cycle will have a duration of 2 seconds. In the next step I set the keyframes for my animation using the <code>@keyframes</code> rule. At <code>0%</code> my font will be animated to <code>"VROT" -30, "HROT" 30</code> and to <code>"VROT" 30, "HROT" -30</code> at the end of the two seconds and vice versa. I can also add in intermediate points at, say, <code>50%</code> so 2 seconds in our case (careful with easing functions this might alter the timeline, see »Further reading«).<br>

            </div>
            <h2 class="">
                Mouse interactions and pseudo-classes
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
                Let’s say we want to perform the same animation, but only when I hover over the font using my mouse. This can be achieved using the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class. These come in handy when you want to select specific elements in your HTML markup. So for example the element that you just hovered or the nth element in a list. We can just add the wanted behaviour in our CSS like so: <br>
                <code>
                    .vfont {<br>
                    font-family: "MyFont";<br>
                    }<br>
                    <br>
                    .vfont:hover {<br>
                    animation: my-animation 2s infinite alternate;<br>
                    }<br>
                    <br>
                    @keyframes my-animation {<br>
                    0%{<br>
                    font-variation-settings: "VROT" -30, "HROT" 30;<br>
                    }<br>
                    100%{<br>
                    font-variation-settings: "VROT" 30, "HROT" -30;<br>
                    }<br>
                    }
                </code> <br>
                In that case my animation only is played, when the <code>.vfont</code> class gets hovered.<br>
                Another way to achieve this (maybe even better for the case of hover animations) are transitions. A transtition controls the speed and the way two states of one class are animated. For our above example this would look as follows:<br>
                <code>
                    .vfont {<br>
                    font-family: "MyFont";<br>
                    font-variation-settings: "VROT" 30, "HROT" -30;<br>
                    transition: 2s;<br>
                    }<br>
                    <br>
                    .vfont:hover {<br>
                    font-variation-settings: "VROT" -30, "HROT" 30;<br>
                    }</code>
                Important to note is that each animated property is given a value in bothe the <code>.vfont</code> class and also its <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class. Other than that transitions work more or less equivalent to animations. 
            </div>
