                Taking off into design space
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
                This week we will get started with your projects. For this we will first talk about the concept of design spaces. Last week we already briefly touched axes that define parameters of a font. If we think of these axes as axes in space like rods that »keep up a tent« we could quickly imagine what adding further axes could mean: adding a further dimension to the system. For type design his idea was popularised by Dutch type designer and educator Gerrit Noordzij, who thought about designing type using three dimensions and playing with contrast, and letter construction in two dimensions (translation and expansion). To visualize his concept he came up with the idea of a cube to show multiple axes of variation on a x, y, and z axis — in three dimensional space so to say. You can take a look at the cube in 3D <a href="https://haw-type-design.github.io/noordzij-cube/" target="_blank">here</a> and read more about Noordzij’s theory <a href="https://typemedia.org/noordzij/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                But back to design spaces and your projects. This week we’ll start developing your ideas for your fonts. For this we will start to think about your design spaces. In other words: what do you want your fonts to do? This is a rather important question to ask before starting to draw, as what you want to do will influence how you will draw it. While you are thinking about this, a few questions to keep in mind:
                <ul>
                    <li>Do all of my Glyphs change at once or do I want to affect just selected ones?</li>
                    <li>Do my Glyphs change fluently from one drawing to another or do I have switching points where drawing A changes to drawing B?</li>
                    <li>Do I want interdependencies? In other words: do I want A to happen if B happens but not the other way round?</li>
                    <li>How do I want my font to look?</li>
                    <li>How will it be used? How large will it be displayed?</li>
                    <li>Do I need color?</li>
                </ul>
                You don’t need all of the answers right away but keeping those questions in mind will help you construct your fonts and your design spaces. If, for example, you want your font to do two things at a time (i.e. change weight and width) you will need at least two axes. This means that you will have a minimum of four extreme points at the minimum of weight and width, minimum weight and maximum width, minimum width and maximum weight, and maximum weight and width. This again means that you need to draw most likely at least four instances. Keep that in mind when thinking about your ideas. A rule of thumb is that for each additional axis you’ll need the amount of axes squared as amount of drawn instances. Additionally, you will get interdependencies that will be hard to handle. Intermediate interpolation states where axes affect one another in ways that you might not anticipate. So try to limit yourself to a minimum.

                Switching shapes within a glyph at certain axis position — your glyph construction can alternate along a variable axis.
