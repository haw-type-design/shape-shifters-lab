                This week I will not have much to say, other than: keep producing!<br>
                After putting our first ideas and letter shapes into form last week (primarily n and o), this week we’ll have time for expanding our character and test first words. As has already been mentioned last week, we can make use of modularity to quickly test first letter shapes in words. That is indeed a good idea for this week: try to sketch out first words like »adhesion« or »hamburgefonts« to test the letters that you have and as a means to creating new ones. Print and test your fonts in between to judge your letter shapes. <br>
                Keep going. Your first drawing might not be perfect but just keep refining it. Test your ideas. If something comes to your mind. wuickly sketch it out and most importantly test it in combination with other letters.

                Proofing
            </h2>
            <div class="text">
               Once your character set sufficiently evolves, it is good practice to get into a mode of proofing. What does proofing mean? It means testing you font systematically in different settings. So if you are working on a design that is meant for reading, it is a good idea to set up a document with text in reading size. Get an InDesign or web document ready, tweak your fonts, export again and test it. You can use <a href="https://github.com/simonthi/haw-type-tools-resources/tree/main/testing/html-test" target="_blank">this test doucment</a> and get some first experience with HTML and CSS. You can also make use of <a href="https://glyphsapp.com/learn/testing-your-fonts-in-adobe-apps" target="_blank">this trick</a>, to keep your InDesign document updated with the newest font.
