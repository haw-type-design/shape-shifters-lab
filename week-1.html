                You might ask yourself: »What on earth is a variable font and how do I get started with it?«. Bear with me. In the course of this semester we will get the hang of it and fully understand the whats, hows and abouts of this technology. Please don’t be shy, ask any question that comes to your mind and pull the most out of this course. But let’s start right at the beginning and get right to the core: What is a variable font?<br>
                Really simplifying things, one could say: »it’s many fonts in one«. Not having »many fonts in one« was – back in the early days of variable fonts – quite a burden, especially on the web. Back then

                the glyph shapes in modern fonts [were] restricted to a single, static configuration. Any variation in weight, width, stroke contrast, etc.—no matter how subtle—require[d] separate font files.

                Since then variable fonts have seen increasing use on the web – but not only in this medium. However, many uses are still restricted to the »classic« styles of typography as are the above mentioned variables – i.e. weight, width etc.

                Speaking of variables: for now we only slightly touched what variable fonts are and how they work. So let us dive into some terminology. <br>
                Variable fonts can be varied along so called axes. This just means, that each variable – that’s also where the name <i>variable fonts</i> comes from – such as weight, width, you name it, is attached to an axe along which the font can be interpolated. Interpolation means, that each point that describes the outline of each glyph will be translated between two or more points – the so called drawn instances. Drawn instances are two or more actual outline drawings of letter shapes. Preferably they sit at the extremes of each axis. So in the example of a weight axis this would be an Extra Light and an Extra Bold weight for example.

                Axes can be separate from one another or interdependent. This means that for example you can have a weight axis and another axis for an italic angle. If everything should work together, so for example you want a Light Semi-Italic, you will create something called a Designspace.

                In this course we will mainly use <a href="https://glyphsapp.com" target="_blank">Glyphs</a> to draw our letter shapes and setup our variable fonts. However, for more experimental stuff we might branch out and use other tools as well. If you are familiar with another Software such as <a href="https://robofont.com/" target="_blank">Robofont</a>, <a href="https://fontforge.org/" target="_blank">FontForge</a> or <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/" target="_blank">FontLab</a> please feel free to use these! We might also touch using the <a href="https://github.com/simonthi/haw-type-tools-resources#%EF%B8%8F-command-line" target="_blank">command line</a>. I highly encourage you to play around and experiment with tools and software that you are not familiar with. Sometimes just using a different software helps, making your ideas come true and not let the computer prescribe what you can and can not do. <br>
                This week we’ll setup a variable font. As a starter I set up a Glyphs <a href="https://cdn.githubraw.com/simonthi/shape-shifters/main/week-1/Variable_Setup.glyphs" download target="_blank">template file</a> for you. In this File, opening the Font Info (⌘I) you will find:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Font tab: an axis named <i>Axis 1</i> with the tag <i>AXIS</i>, the name can be anything and will be used to label your axes, the tag is used i.e. in CSS to control your axes. Tags are restricted to four letters, all uppercase if you define an axis other than the prefabricated in Glyphs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Master tab: two drawn instances (attention: I try to not use the word Master, as is referred to by Glyphs but drawn instances), named <i>Drawn Instance 1</i> and <i>Drawn Instance 2</i>. Not their respective axis positions. Those serve as the above mentioned extremes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Export tab: two Instances that will get exported as single styles <i>Drawn Instance 1</i> and <i>Drawn Instance 2</i>. These are styles that are selectible through font menus i.e. in TextEdit. Note that exporting any instance between the two extremes is possible, just enter their respective axis position.
                    </li>
                </ul>
